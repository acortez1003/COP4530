Worst-Case Run-Time Complexity of clear() in Stack Template Class
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The worst-case run-time complexity of member function clear() is purely dependent
on the container that I chose. the container I used was the vector STL.
For reference, this is my clear() function:

template <typename T>
void Stack<T>::clear()
{
    data.clear();
}
so it directly calls vector's clear function.

For a vector, you typically have to use the delete keywordand then reset 
all of the member data. Resetting all of the member data is constant at O(1), 
but the delete keyword traverses through each data element, which is O(n). 
Therefore, the time-complexity for my clear() functionis O(n) because it calls 
on vector's clear() function which traverses through each data element.
